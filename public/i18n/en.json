    "anyQuestions": "Any questions?",
    "anyQuestionsParagraph": "Here are the answers to the most frequently asked questions.",

    "question1": "Why is our app so special?",
    "question1Answer": "We are building a fully decentralized platform. Many top-tier projects have a centralized backend, which means that even if a project has the \"cryptocurrency\" label, it is actually a centralized app that you pay to use, not a smart contract. This makes the app centralized, and your funds are easily controlled by the company. We don't manage anything. Instead, we use smart contracts with open source code on the blockchain. This ensures the safety of your funds.",

    "question2": "Why should I buy the NFT?",
    "question2Answer": "Of course, you shouldn't, but having them would make a huge difference after the launch of the DApp. You could miss the opportunity to have the best and most rewarding experience with the app.",

    "question3": "Is there are any drops or free tokens?",
    "question3Answer": "No! We are not a crypto-scam project. We aim to create a fully decentralized platform that will provide the best benefits of TON blockchain technology to our users. We may offer rewards for holding our NFTs in the future, but we are not just another click-and-earn project.",

    "question4": "How can i earn real money with this?",
    "question4Answer": "Now there is only one way, and that is to play the CryptoRoll app. Bet your money and try to beat your opponents to earn more. You can also enhance your experience and earn even more rewards by holding our NFTs.",

    "question5": "Why is there only coinflip?",
    "question5Answer": "We don't have an actual app at the moment, but we are working on one. Developing such an app takes time and a lot of hard work. The current Coinflip is not the actual Cryptotroll app. This app was created by the founder of the project and is a demo version for users to see what a real decentralized app would be like.",

    "question6": "Is there a way to become a private member?",
    "question6Answer": "At the moment, there is no such opportunity. However, after the launch of the DApp, it is planned to create some spaces and communities for our NFT holders.",
